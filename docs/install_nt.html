<h2>1. Installation Overview</h2>

<p>In the following installation procedure, we assume that you have 
already downloaded DCForum+ tar.gz file to a window-based PC and that you will 
be using an FTP program to install it on your web server.  
</p>
<p>
If you downloaded DCForum+ tar.gz file directly onto your web server, 
then copy the files to appropriate directories instead of uploading them.
</p>


<h2>2. Installing DCForum+</h2>
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE</STRONG>: PLEASE MAKE 
SURE YOU USE <STRONG>ASCII MODE</STRONG>

<P>There are more than one way to setup DCForum+ system. The following setup 
what we recommend. </P>

<STRONG>Installation Steps</STRONG>
<p>
Change directory to your root html directory. By root html directory we mean the 
directory corresponding to your home site URL.
<OL>
   <li>            
   Create a subdirectory called "dc".

   <li>  Set your FTP program to transfer files  in BINARY model.

   <li> Create a subdirectory called "images" in the "dc" directory.

   <li> Change directory to "images".  Create a directory named "avatars"

   <li> Upload /images/*.gif files to /images directory.      
               

   <li> Change directory to "/images/avatars".
   
   <li> Upload /images/avatars/*.gif files to /images/avatars 
  directory    
   
   <li> Change directory to "dc" directory    
   
   <li> Set your FTP program to transfer files 
  in ASCII mode    
   
   <li> Create a subdirectory called "admin_lib" in 
  the "dc" directory     
   
   <li> Change directory to "admin_lib" directory    
   
   <li> Upload files in your local /admin_lib directory 
  to this directory    
   
   <li> Repeat steps 10 - 13 for "cal", "include", 
  "lib", "jscss", "docs",  and "templates" directory    
   <li>Change directory to "dc" directory
   <li>Create a directory named &quot;lang&quot;. Upload all /lang files to this
  directory, preserving its directory structure   
   <li> Change directory to "dc" directory    
   
   <li> Create a subdirectory called "user_files" and "temp_files"&nbsp;in 
  the "dc" directory.  This directory must be set to "READ/WRITE/DELETE FOR EVERYONE".
  You may need to ask your hosting company to set this permission for you.    
   
   <li> Upload following files to "dc" directory: dcboard.php, 
  dcadmin.php and index.html.</li></OL>       
           
   
   <p> NOTE - Please note that you may also drag-and-drop "dc" 
directory from your local PC to the server's root directory so long as you setup 
your FTP program to automatically recognize .php, .inc, .html file extension as ASCII text files and 
  .gif and .jpg as image files.</p>


<h2> 3. Creating a backup directory</h2>
<p>DCForum+ allows you to make a backup of your entire database using 
mysqldmp function.  In order to perform this action, however, there are two thing things that you
must consider.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Creating a backup directory can wait until you finish your installation.
You may elect to get the forum running before you revisit this issue.</p>

<p>1. In order for the browser to create a backup and save it to
a location on your server, we need to create a backup directory so that
the browser has the permission to write a flie in that directory.  In a nutshell,
this means that the backup 
directory must be set to "READ/WRITE/DELETE FOR EVERYONE" permission</p>


<p>2. A more important requirement for this backup directory 
is that the contents of this directory must not be accessible via the 
browser.  Therefore, you must create this backup directory above your root 
HTML directory that your hosting company has setup for you.  For example, 
they may have a directory named "data" or "cgi-out" where it is not accessible using the browser.</p>


<p>You may also place this backup directory below your 
cgi-bin directory if this directory is set to execute scripts only.  If you are not sure, do a
simple test.  Place a simple html file in your cgi-bin directory and try to 
view this file.  If setup correctly, you should get an internal server 
error.  On the other hand, if you can view this html file, then you 
cannot create a backup directory in your cgi-bin directory. </p>


<p>Once you determine where where to create this backup 
directory, create the directory and set this directory to 777.</p>


<h2>4. Edit dcsetup.php</h2>
<p>
   This file contains parameters that DCForum+ requires to run.  You won't
   need to edit most of them.  Just to get it started, you'll only need 
   to define the following variables in dcsetup.php  
</p>
<p>   Database parameters - Ask your ISP 
what these values are<BR>   
-------------------------------<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DB_HOST&nbsp; 
-&nbsp;Typically&nbsp;"localhost" since most MySQL servers are on the same 
server as&nbsp;web server<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; DB_NAME&nbsp; - 
database&nbsp;name<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; DB_USERNAME - database 
username<BR>
              
                  
     &nbsp;&nbsp; DB_PASSWORD - database password  
</p>
<p>   Forum parameters<BR>   
--------------------------------<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; ROOT_URL -&nbsp;This is the URL 
to /dc&nbsp;directory...for example, http://www.yourdomain.com/dc
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; COOKIE_DOMAIN -&nbsp;This should be .yourdomain.com
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; BACKUP_DIR - Location where backup file will be saved. 
</p>

<p>
   Open dcsetup.php file in your text editor and define these variables.
     Once you're done, upload dcsetup.php to your /dc directory.
</p>


<h2>   5. Start dcadmin.php.</h2>

<p>
     Start dcadmin.php by opening this page using your  browser. The URL should
   be something like,
</p>
<P>http://www.yourdomain.com/dc/dcadmin.php </P>
   
<p>
   The
   firsttime you run this program, it will ask you to read the
   DCForum+ End-User Licensing Agreement.  Click ok to continue with installation.
</p>

<p>
   Follow the instruction as provided until you have registered and
   login page appears.  Proceed with login and this will bring you to 
   the main page of the forum.  Look for the "admin"
   menu icon.  Clicking on this icon will bring up the administrator's
   program.
</p>
   
<p>
   If you get any errors during above steps, please go back and check 
   to make sure that all path variables and permissions are set correctly.  
   Also, check and make sure that you didn't use BINARY mode when you
   transfer the files.  If you're still stuck, use our support forum at

<h2>   6. Post-installation steps</h2>

<p>If you did not receive any errors thus far, then you are all set with DCForum+ installation.
Now, go ahead and login as the administrator.
You should not have access to the forum administration utilities.
Please refer to the <A href="admin.html">administrator user's guide</A> for post-installation setup
and configuration.
