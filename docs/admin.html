<h2><a name="3">  3.&nbsp; Setting up forums</a></h2>
<p>
   Once the forum options are set, the next step is to
create forums. There are couple of things that you should
think about before you begin.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Should you setup multiple conferences?</b> A conference is a group of forums belonging to a similar 
  theme.&nbsp; While, in the strict sense, a &nbsp;conference is a
	 forum type, it can only contain children forums and cannot contain
	topics.&nbsp; Whether you need multiple conferences or not will depend on how
	many forums you will be setting up. If you are going to
	set up over 10 forums, then it is a good idea to group those
	forums into two or more conferences. On the other hand,
   if you are only going to set up 5 or 6 forums then you would only
	need to create a single conference.  In this case, you can create a
	conference named 'Main' and assign all your forums to this
	conference.
<li><b>What type of forums will you need?</b> DCForum+ supports four types of forums: 
Public, Protected, Restricted and Private.&nbsp; If you want to allow everyone to 
participate without requiring registration, then choose Public forums. 
If you want to allow everyone to read but require 
	registration to post messages, then choose Protected.&nbsp; 
	If&nbsp;you only want users in 'member' user group to have access
   to your forums for both read and 
	write, then choose restricted forums.&nbsp;
   Lastly,  private forums are highly exclusive in that,
	 the users must be elevated to
   'member' user group in order to qualify to use them.  
	Additionally, the moderator of that forum must grant access to his/her private 
	forums. Also keep in mind that threads in private and restricted forums are 
	dynamically generated each time it is viewed. They are not saved as static html 
	pages. They are not suitable for heavy traffic forums due to server load.
<li><b>Will you need moderated forums?</b> Moderated forums allow you to preview 
the messages before they are posted in the forums. It works with all four forum 
types. Whether you need this level of security will depend on your needs. 
Moderation creates considerable amount of additional labor for administrators and 
moderators.</li>                        
</ul>

<h3><U>Creating A Forum</U>  </h3>
<ol>
<li> From Forum Manager menu, choose "Create New Forum".
<li> Select a forum type - choose from public, protected, restricted, private, or conference.
<li>        
       Select parent forum.
<li> Enter forum name.
<li> Enter forum description.
<li> Select forum moderator(s).&nbsp; NOTE - all users with 
  admin or moderator group are listed.
<li> Select forum mode - if you select 'yes' to Moderated 
  forum&nbsp;option, this forum will be a moderated forum
<li> Select forum status. If 'not active', this forum will 
  not be displayed.
<li> Select top template file name
<li>        Select
     bottom template file name
<li> Click on 'Submit' button.</li>        
</ol>

<p>
Congratulations!  You have now setup DCForum+ for your
web site.  Now, let's customize your forum layout.

does not include &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; section as these are
