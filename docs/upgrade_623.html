<h2>1. Installation Overview</h2>

<p>In the following installation procedure, we assume that you have 
already downloaded DCForum+ tar.gz file to a window-based PC and that you will 
be using an FTP program to install it on your web server.  
</p>
<p>
If you downloaded DCForum+ tar.gz file directly onto your web server, 
then copy the files to appropriate directories instead of uploading them.
</p>

<p>
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT "chmod" FUNCTION IS OR DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CHANGE
FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS, PLEASE READ <A href="about_chmod.txt">about_chmod.txt</A>

</pre>

                                 
<STRONG>Installation Steps</STRONG>
<p>
Change directory to your root html directory. By root html directory we mean the 
directory corresponding to your home site URL.
<OL>
   <li>            
   Create a subdirectory called "dc".

   <li>  Set your FTP program to transfer files  in BINARY model.

   <li> Create a subdirectory called "images" in the "dc" directory.

   <li> Change directory to "images".  Create a directory named "avatars"

   <li> Upload /images/*.gif files to /images directory.      
               
   <li> Change directory to "/images/avatars".
   
   <li> Upload /images/avatars/*.gif files to /images/avatars 
  directory    
   
   <li> Change directory to "dc" directory    
   
   <li> Set your FTP program to transfer files 
  in ASCII mode    
   
   <li> Create a subdirectory called "admin_lib" in 
  the "dc" directory     
   
   <li> Change directory to "admin_lib" directory    
   
   <li> Upload files in your local /admin_lib directory 
  to this directory    
   
   <li> Repeat steps 10 - 13 for "cal", "include", 
  "lib", "jscss", "docs",  and "templates" directory.  

   <li> Change directory to "dc" directory.

   <li> Create a subdirectory named "lang". 

   <li> Change directory to "lang" directory.  Upload all contents of
        lang directory to this directory.  Be sure to preserve
        its directory structure        
   
   <li> Change directory to "dc" directory    
   
   <li> Create a subdirectory called "user_files" and "temp_files"&nbsp;in 
  the "dc" directory.  Chmod this directory to 777.     
   
   <li> Upload following files to "dc" directory: dcboard.php, 
  dcadmin.php, readme.html  and index.html.</li></OL>       
           
   
   <p> NOTE - Please note that you may also drag-and-drop "dc" 
directory from your local PC to the server's root directory so long as you setup 
your FTP program to automatically recognize .php, .inc, .html file extension as ASCII text files and 
  .gif and .jpg as image files.</p>


<h2> 3. Creating a backup directory</h2>
<p>DCForum+ allows you to make a backup of your entire database using 
mysqldmp function.  In order to perform this action, however, there are two thing things that you
must consider.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Creating a backup directory can wait until you finish your installation.
You may elect to get the forum running before you revisit this issue.</p>

<p>1. In order for the browser to create a backup and save it to
a location on your server, we need to create a backup directory so that
the browser has the permission to write a flie in that directory.  In a nutshell,
this means that the backup 
directory must be set to 777 permission</p>


<p>2. A more important requirement for this backup directory 
is that the contents of this directory must not be accessible via the 
browser.  Therefore, you must create this backup directory above your root 
HTML directory that your hosting company has setup for you.  For example, 
they may have a directory named "data" or "cgi-out" where it is not accessible using the browser.</p>


<p>You may also place this backup directory below your 
cgi-bin directory if this directory is set to execute scripts only.  If you are not sure, do a
simple test.  Place a simple html file in your cgi-bin directory and try to 
view this file.  If setup correctly, you should get an internal server 
error.  On the other hand, if you can view this html file, then you 
cannot create a backup directory in your cgi-bin directory. </p>

<p>Once you determine where where to create this backup 
directory, create the directory and set this directory to 777.</p>


<h2>4. Edit dcsetup.php</h2>
<p>
   This file contains parameters that DCForum+ requires to run.  You won't
   need to edit most of them.  Just to get it started, you'll only need 
   to define the following variables in dcsetup.php  
</p>
<p>   Database paramters - Ask your ISP 
what these values are<BR>   
-------------------------------<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DB_HOST&nbsp; 
-&nbsp;Typically&nbsp;"localhost" since most MySQL servers are on the same 
server as&nbsp;web server<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; DB_NAME&nbsp; - 
database&nbsp;name<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; DB_USERNAME - database 
username<BR>
              
                  
     &nbsp;&nbsp; DB_PASSWORD - database password  
</p>
<p>   Forum parameters<BR>   
--------------------------------<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; ROOT_URL -&nbsp;This is the URL 
to /dc&nbsp;directory...for example, http://www.yourdomain.com/dc
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; COOKIE_DOMAIN -&nbsp;This should be .yourdomain.com
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; BACKUP_DIR - Location where backup file will be saved.  This can wait until your forum is installed.
</p>

<p>Import parameters - Following directories must be FULL PATHS <br >
--------------------------------<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; OLD_USER_INFO - Directory path to User_info direcoty
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; OLD_MAIN_DIR - Directory path to 
$maindir from the old forum<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; OLD_PRIVATE_DIR 
- Directory path to $private_forums from the         old forum&nbsp;
</p>



<p>
   Open dcsetup.php file in your text editor and define these variables.
     Once you're done, upload dcsetup.php to your /dc directory.
</p>


<h2>   5. Start dcadmin.php.</h2>

<p>
     Start dcadmin.php by opening this page using your  browser. The URL should
   be something like,
</p>
<P>http://www.yourdomain.com/dc/dcadmin.php </P>
   
<p>
   The
   firsttime you run this program, it will ask you to read the
   DCForum+ End-User Licensing Agreement.  Click ok to continue with installation.
</p>

<p>
   Follow the instruction as provided until you have registered and
   login page appears.  Proceed with login and this will bring you to 
   the main page of the forum.  Look for the "admin"
   menu icon.  Clicking on this icon will bring up the administrator's
   program.
</p>
   
<p>
   If you get any errors during above steps, please go back and check 
   to make sure that all path variables and permissions are set correctly.  
   Also, check and make sure that you didn't use BINARY mode when you
   transfer the files.  If you're still stuck, use our support forum at

   Or email us at support@dcscripts.com.
</p>   

<h2>6. Import old data</h2>

<p><STRONG>NOTE - Please make sure that&nbsp;no 
two&nbsp;forums have the same forum name. If any two or more forums have same 
forum name, please rename the forums before you perform this upgrade.&nbsp; 
Failure to make this change can cause errors</STRONG>                                             </p>
<p>NOTE - DCForum+ automatically creates two user accounts: 
root and guest 
<p><STRONG>Before you import DCForum 6.23 data, please 
prune forum log and ip log files using the DCForum 6.23 utility.</STRONG>          
<p>
If you are logged in as root, you should have access to the administration utility.  Once of the menu items in this utility will allow you to import your old forum data.  To do so, perform following task in <strong>exact order</strong>:
<ol>
<li> <strong>Import user accounts from DCF 6.2x</strong> - This option imports user data. <STRONG>If the browser 
  appears to stop beforeall user database is imported, you may rerun this 
  function until all user records are imported.</STRONG>           
               
       <BR>           
               
      
  <UL></UL>
<li> <strong>Import misc user files from DCF 6.2x</strong> - Imports user rating file <BR>     
<li> <strong>Import forum data and messages from DCF 6.2x</strong> - Imports forum data from forum_info.txt and 
  each forums.&nbsp; This utility will import 100 topics at a time to avoid CGI 
  timeout.&nbsp; If you still experience CGI time out, 
  modify<BR><BR>$num_topics<BR><BR>variable in 
  upgrade_manager_import_forum_mesg.php so that 
  you reduce the CGI processing time.<BR>                 
<li> <strong>Import forum log data</strong> - Imports forum log data</li>     
</ol>
<P></P>
<P>Once you've imported all the forum data, browse your new forum and see if 
everything seems normal before you proceed to the next step.&nbsp; Specifically 
check and compare topics in the new forum to the old DCF 6.23 forum.</P>

<h2>   7. Post-installation steps</h2>

<p>If you did not receive any errors thus far, then you are all set with DCForum+ installation.
Now, go ahead and login as the administrator.
You should not have access to the forum administration utilities.
Please refer to the <A href="admin.html">administrator user's guide</A> for post-installation setup
and configuration.
