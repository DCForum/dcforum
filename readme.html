<H2>Getting Started...</H2>
<P>Thank you for choosing DCForum+!</P>

<p>       DCForum+ is a complete 
web conferencing software for building and managing an online discussion 
community. DCForum+ is PhP/MySQL implementation of highly popular DCForum.&nbsp; Whether you are 
managing your company's online support program or simply providing an 
interactive environment for internet users of common interest, you'll find the 
proven technology you need in DCForum.</p>

<p>DCForum+ is developed to meet the following design goals:</p>
<OL>
   <li><STRONG>Easy Installation</STRONG>           
              - A typical DCForum+ 
      installation requires editing only one setup file.

   <li><STRONG>PhP/MySQL</STRONG> 
  &nbsp; - DCForum+ inherits its design from popular DCForum.&nbsp; Unlike 
  DCForum, &nbsp;which is written in Perl and&nbsp;supports text-delimited database, &nbsp;DCForum+ is implemented using PhP with 
      MySQL backend support and is capable of handling increased traffic.

   <li><STRONG>Clean and Intuitive User Interface</STRONG>      - The interface is the most important 
      aspect of a good forum software. It is imperative to keep it clean, 
      intuitive, and user-friendly.

   <li><STRONG>Easily Customizable Interface</STRONG>      - The overall layout of the forum 
      must be easily customizable in order to expedite the integration process 
      of the forum to the rest of your site. You can accomplish this 
      by modifying&nbsp;two template files&nbsp; 

   <li><STRONG>Fully Threaded Style of Discussion</STRONG> - While&nbsp;users 
  can select to use&nbsp; <STRONG> linear discussion style</STRONG>, we 
  strongly believe that the fully threaded discussion format is the ideal style 
  for a web conferencing software. Unlike the linear messaging style boards, 
  DCForum allows one-to-one interaction among forum users and reduces the 
  difficulty of subscribing to a particular thread among thousands of posts.</li>
   <li><strong>NEW - Multiple language option</strong> - With DCF+ 1.2, you can
     now allow your users to use different language to display forum information.
     The initial release will only include English modules but future release
     will contain additional modules&nbsp;</li>
</OL>

<p>
DCForum+ supports a 
wide variety of web servers running on both UNIX (LINUX, SOLARIS, FREEBSD, etc) 
and Windows server platforms. The only requirement  for running DCForum+
is that your web server supports PhP application with MySQL backend 
support. With proven software backed by our devoted support staff, 
you can now begin focusing on building your community.
</p>
<p>
Thank you again for choosing DCForum+.
