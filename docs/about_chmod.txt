An introduction to changing file and directory permissions
================================================================

Installing Perl CGI programs on UNIX-based web servers typically
involve creating directories, uploading files, and then changing 
their permissions.  The unix command for changing file or
directory permission is called "chmod".  If you know how to chmod
then you do not need to read this documentation. Otherwise, please 
continue reading this Section

In order for a perl CGI program to run on your web server, 
it must have proper file permission.  Specifically, the CGI 
script must have EXECUTE permission.  You need to set *.cgi 
files to 755, which grants read/write/execute permission to 
the owner and read/execute to the group and world.

Additionally, if your perl CGI program needs to:

   1. create and remove directories
   2. create, modify, and delete files
   3. read, write, and append to files

then directories and files must all have proper permissions.  This 
means that certain directories need to be set to 777, which 
grants read/write/execute permission to owner/group/world.  

If you have telnet access, type (from the command line):

   chmod 755 file.cgi

to set file.cgi to 755 permission.  Or, you can use

   chmod 777 some_directory
   
to set some_directory to 777 permission.

If you are using an FTP program, there should be a function that
allow you to change the permission by selecting a file on your server.
For example, if you are using CuteFTP (Version 4.2), then you can
select a file or a directory on the server, then click on "Commands"
from the menu and then "Change Permissions".  Choosing this option
will bring up a dialog box where you can choose read/write/execute
permissions for owner/group/world.
